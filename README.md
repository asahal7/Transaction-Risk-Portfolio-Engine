Transaction Risk Portfolio Engine
A Java-based portfolio engine focused on correctness, state management, and risk modelling for financial transactions.
This project simulates how real-world portfolio systems apply transactions, enforce invariants, and compute risk under changing market conditions.
The primary goal is to demonstrate engineering decision-making around immutability, idempotency, and extensible system design — not just feature output.
Why this project exists
Financial systems are not just about calculations — they are about correct state transitions.
This project explores:
How to safely apply buy/sell transactions to a portfolio
How to prevent invalid or duplicate transaction execution
How to maintain portfolio correctness while optimising performance
How to design systems that remain extensible as complexity grows
Core Concepts Demonstrated
Invariant Enforcement
Portfolio state is protected across all buy/sell operations to prevent invalid transitions.
Transaction Identity & Immutability
Transactions are immutable and uniquely identified, separating transaction definition from application logic to prevent double execution.
Idempotent Application
The portfolio enforces that a transaction can only be applied once, even if attempted multiple times.
Efficient State Aggregation
Portfolio value is cached and updated incrementally, reducing total valuation from repeated recomputation to O(1).
Extensible Risk Modelling
Risk calculations are abstracted to support future asset types and volatility models without rewriting core logic.
High-Level Architecture
Transaction
Immutable representation of a financial action (buy/sell), containing identity and value.
Asset
Represents holdings and valuation logic for individual assets.
Portfolio
Owns all mutable state and is solely responsible for applying transactions and enforcing invariants.
RiskCalculator
Encapsulates portfolio-level risk computation with clean separation from core state logic.
This separation ensures clear ownership of responsibility, a key principle in maintainable backend systems.
Example Usage
Portfolio portfolio = new Portfolio();

Transaction buy = new Transaction(Transaction.Type.BUY, "AAPL", 1000);
Transaction sell = new Transaction(Transaction.Type.SELL, "AAPL", 500);

portfolio.applyTransaction(buy);
portfolio.applyTransaction(sell);

double totalValue = portfolio.getTotalValue();
double portfolioRisk = portfolio.calculateRisk();
The portfolio guarantees:
Transactions are applied once
State remains consistent after every operation
Risk reflects the current portfolio state
Technologies Used
Java 8
Object-Oriented Design
Collections & State Management
Basic risk simulation logic
(No external frameworks — focus is on core language and design fundamentals.)
Design Trade-offs & Decisions
Why immutability for transactions?
Prevents accidental mutation and makes transaction history reliable.
Why enforce application logic in Portfolio?
Centralises state mutation and avoids scattered business rules.
Why cache total portfolio value?
Improves performance while maintaining correctness through controlled updates.
These decisions mirror patterns used in real-world backend and financial systems.
Future Improvements
More advanced risk models
Historical transaction replay
Persistent storage
Concurrency-safe transaction application
REST API interface
What this project demonstrates
This project is less about output and more about how systems should behave under constraints.
It reflects how I think about:
Backend correctness
State ownership
Defensive design
Scalable abstractions
